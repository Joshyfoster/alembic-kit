Each week, I plan to create a series of posts which outline my research and discovery of new trees from around the world. \nYou may ask yourself why this fool is deciding to make a blog dedicated to trees? Good question, the answer is well.. I don’t really know. This year I decided I wanted to learn a new skill, and well, Web Development and Design is what I chose. What better way to learn about development and design then to create a website on trees? Join me on my journey to educate myself and the wider web on trees, BIG, small, interesting, or unique.\n\nA little about me.\n\nMy name is Josh. Im currently 25 years of age and I am employed fulltime in the Health sector. I reside in Australia in the suburbs of sydney. This website is a little project of mine. I hope you enjoy.\n\n",
