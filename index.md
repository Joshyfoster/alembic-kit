Welcome to Trees of the World (TOTW). A Blog about.. well.. trees from around the world. Each week, I plan to create a series of posts which outline my research and discovery of new trees from around the world. 
You may ask yourself why this fool is deciding to make a blog dedicated to trees? Good question, the answer is well.. I don't really know. This year I decided I wanted to learn a new skill, and well, Web Development and Design is what I chose. What better way to learn about development and design then to create a website on trees? Join me on my journey to educate myself and the wider web on trees, BIG, small, interesting, or unique.  

## A little about me.

My name is Josh. Im currently 25 years of age and I am employed fulltime in the Health sector. I reside in Australia in the suburbs of sydney. This website is a little project of mine. I hope you enjoy.
